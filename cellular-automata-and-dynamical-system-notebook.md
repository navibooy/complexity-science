# Cellular Automata and Dynamical System Models Reflection
Last session we went through the Cellular Automata and Dynamical System Models notebook which was an eye-opener for me in how I view complexity in natural phenomenons. I didn't expect something that starts with grids, boxes, and simple rules end up modeling real-world things like disease outbreaks, information spread, or even natural disasters. But that is what exactly was demonstrated in this notebook. We have explored **percolation theory** which explores how a global structure or connectivity arises from random local interactions. **Diffusion models** delved into how information or diseases spread across populations through the concept of activated and susceptible agents. Finally, **Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld Sandpile Model** is discussed which is a concept where a system naturally evolves into a critical state where small changes can lead to large-scale events.

While studying these models, one specific example I found personally impactful was the modeling of information cascades in financial markets. Just as a small sand grain in the BTW model can trigger collapse, a minor market rumor can spark panic selling which highlights the fragility of interconnected systems, and the importance of resilience planning. In fact, the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld Sandpile Model is incredibly relevant to **systemic risk** in finance. Think of each institution such as banks and hedge funds as a “cell” in the grid. When one institution faces stress due to bad loans, mispricing of risk, or unexpected defaults, it can “topple,” affecting those directly connected to it. If too many institutions are tightly connected, the stress propagates leading to a financial avalanche, like what happened during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. One firm’s collapse set off a chain reaction because everyone was exposed to everyone else through complex financial instruments.

In the end, what really struck me is how small, simple rules can lead to big, complex outcomes. I used to think that to model complicated things, you needed equally complicated functions or formulas. But now I realize it's not always about the compexity in the code but rather it is about how interactions build up over time. Learning about cellular automata and dynamical systems taught me more than just how these models work. It reminded me that the world is full of hidden patterns. Things that look random might actually be the result of simple rules repeated over and over. And things that look stable might be one small push away from collapse. Understanding this gives me better tools for both analyzing problems. Whether it’s how people behave, how systems fail, or how trends spread. These models offer a new way of seeing and understanding the world.
