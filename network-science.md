# Network Science Reflection
Having a financial background, I always make sure to align the topics being discussed with my business acumen. Before diving into Network Science, I always thought of finance in terms of just numbers, ratios and indicators that measures the performance of each company or asset on its own. But after learning how Network Science is used in finance, my perspective changed. It made me realize that financial system is not just a set of isolated entities, but a deeply connected system where relationships matter just as much as individual entities alone. And when I started thinking in terms of networks such as nodes and links, I see the bigger picture.

What really struck me is how useful this is in actual financial systems. For example in the stock market, instead of just looking at a single stock's performance, Network Science provides a better understanding of how stocks move together, how they cluster by sectors or how some are central and influence many others. This has real value in portfolio construction and risk management as it helps investor not only pick assets but also understand how one asset impacts another.

Another example is in risk management, where banks and regulators use network models to simulate what happens if one institution falls. It is not just about how big a bank is but it's about how connected it is to others. A small bank could still cause big problems if it is at the center of a web of contracts or loans. Concepts like "too interconnected to fail" are a direct result of network-based thinking. This is why central banks are now stress-testing not only individual institutions but their links and exposure chains as well. That alone shows how much value Network Science brings to stability.

Lastly, Network Science can be also helpful for fraud detection by building transaction or relationship graphs, as institutions can detect connected fraudsters who would be invisible in traditional systems. Instead of catching one bad actor at a time, Network Science helps find entire networks of frauds acting together. Overall, Network Science made me realize that financial systems are living systems that are interconnected and have a complex relationship and behavior. As someone interested in Finance, it made me think about risks, strategies and decisions in a world that is more connected than ever.
